Creating a superadmin typically involves a manual or controlled process to designate a user as a superadmin. Here's a general process you might follow:

1. **Designate an Initial Superadmin:**
   - Choose an initial user or a set of users who will have the superadmin role. This could be done during the application setup phase.

2. **Include Superadmin Field in User Model:**
   - Modify your user model to include a field that represents the superadmin role. This field can be a boolean or an enum indicating the user's role.

```javascript

const userSchema = new mongoose.Schema({
  username: String,
  password: String,
  role: {
    type: String,
    enum: ['user', 'admin', 'superadmin'],
    default: 'user',
  },
});

```
3. **Superadmin Setup Process:**
   - During the initial setup of your application, manually insert a user into the database with the superadmin role. This could be done using a script or a specific route in your application that is only accessible during the setup phase.

```javascript
const User = require('./models/User'); // Import your User model

// Superadmin setup script
async function setupSuperadmin() {
  try {
    const existingSuperadmin = await User.findOne({ role: 'superadmin' });

    if (!existingSuperadmin) {
      const superadmin = new User({
        username: 'superadmin',
        password: 'superadminpassword', // You should use a secure method for password hashing
        role: 'superadmin',
      });

      await superadmin.save();
      console.log('Superadmin created successfully');
    } else {
      console.log('Superadmin already exists');
    }
  } catch (error) {
    console.error('Superadmin setup failed:', error);
  }
}
```


4. **Security Considerations:**
   - Ensure that the process of setting up the superadmin is secure and follows best practices. For example, use secure password handling, restrict access to the setup process, and encrypt sensitive information.


5. **Additional Authorization Checks:**
   - Once the superadmin is set up, you can implement additional checks in your application logic to ensure that only the superadmin has access to certain routes or actions.

Remember, the superadmin setup process should be handled carefully, and the credentials used for the superadmin should be securely stored. It's also a good practice to have a limited number of superadmins and to change superadmin credentials regularly for security reasons.
